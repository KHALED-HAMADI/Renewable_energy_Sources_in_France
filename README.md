  This project aims to perform exploratory data analysis to define which type of level 2 energy source powerplant contributes the most to the total electrical output. The analysis led to the creation of 3 views. Two views showcase the average electrical output, the total electrical output of each level 2 and level 3 energy source. The results show that wind energy sources are the most effective regarding average and total electrical output. A third view was created that showcases the contribution of each level 2 energy source contribution to the total electrical output. The results show that wind power plants contribute to 65.6% of the total electrical output, followed by hydro with 18.5 %, solar with 11 %, then bioenergy with 4.9 %.
