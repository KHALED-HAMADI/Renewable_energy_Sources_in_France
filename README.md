**Focus:** Conducted an exploratory data analysis to identify the primary contributors among Level 2 energy source power plants to overall electrical output.<br />

**Key Insights:**<br />
Wind power plants are the most effective, contributing 65.6% of the total electrical output, followed by:<br />
Hydro: 18.5%<br />
Solar: 11%<br />
Bioenergy: 4.9%<br />
Analysis included average and total electrical output comparisons for Level 2 and Level 3 energy sources.<br />

**Tools and Visualization:**<br />
Created three SQL-based views to present:<br />
Average and total outputs for Level 2 and Level 3 energy sources.<br />
Contributions of each Level 2 energy source to total electrical output.<br />
