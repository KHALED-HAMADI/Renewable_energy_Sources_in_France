**Data Source and Database**

The project utilizes data downloaded in CSV format, which was then imported into a MySQL local server database.
The database used in this project can be located within this repository.

**Objective**

The primary objective of this project is to conduct exploratory data analysis focused on determining the primary contributor among level 2 energy source power plants to the total electrical output.

**Analysis Overview**

The analysis has resulted in the creation of three distinct views to facilitate understanding:
- Two views showcase the average electrical output and the total electrical output attributed to each level 2 and level 3 energy source.
- The findings from the analysis indicate that wind energy sources display the highest efficacy concerning both average and total electrical output.
- A third view has been generated to demonstrate the contribution of each level 2 energy source to the overall electrical output.
According to the results, wind power plants contribute approximately 65.6% to the total electrical output, followed by hydro with 18.5%, solar with 11%, and bioenergy with 4.9%.
